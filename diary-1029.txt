Now,it's 12PM. now.I have done my homework.For me ,Chinese assignment is the most difficult one for me.I am poor at chinese literature.After two months in senior three,I find my time is limited,I have a lot of work to do,but when I finish my homework,I find no time to do some revision.I should improve my efficiency,and meanwhile have a good rest.
