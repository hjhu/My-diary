Now that I have done my homework in advance,I have time to write the diary.I still have a long way to take part in the final examination especially in chinese,I will have all of my time on english and chinese.Today,I want to write about my deskmates who ranked first in our grade.He is a warn-hearted person,he will help someone who is poor at a particular subject.He will help me in chinese,he also teach me maths,althougth I have a good grade in maths.It's difficult for people to help their rivals.He knows a lot about nearly every subject.He is also a person with positive attitude.He found that I was lacking in confidence,he try his best to persuade me to be a confident people.HOWEVER,he also have some bad habits.He is a person who go to school at the very deadlines.I think this maybe have a bad effect on him.He also eat food in class,which is not a respectful behaviour.In the end I want to say that he is a model in my mind.
