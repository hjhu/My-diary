Today,I finally have enough time to do the all the part of my diary,and I remenber that the day before yesterday I said I would finish all the task I fail to do.It is today when I have to pay off my promise.After one another literature test,I find it is really difficult for me.So yesterday,I ask my Mon to buy some training.I have few time to live.I have a lot of training to do,not only literature.Here are some demands I should do.First,I should finish the school homeworks as quickly as I can,and ensure the accurcy of it.Second,after finishing my homework,I should finish the assignment of all subjects.Finally,I should guarantee my sleeping quality.I should give up most of my bad habits,such as playing phone and looking live show.From today,I should be and must be a really senior high students.I hope one year later,when I open this piece of diary,I am satified with my dicisions today.
