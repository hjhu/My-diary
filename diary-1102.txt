Our English taecher,Emma,who is a best teacher as well as our good friend,devote herself to teaching us. This day, many people got a severe cough.Emma can't speak the word aloud, for she had a bad cough,and she is difficult to speak a word. We will have a mid-term examination. What made me worry most was that I am anxious about the Chinese literature. In following week will have less English, and I hope that Emma can have a sweet voice.
