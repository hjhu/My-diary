This is my second day for me to keep a diary in this way.I think this is a good opportunity for me to improve my English.Since I am a senior three students,I have a lot of homework to do.I believe that I can improve my English writing in this way.Last week,I wrote a composition and teacher told me that my writing was poor in detail.I knew this problem,but I can't write the detail every time I wrote a composition.I decide to write a small article everyday to improve my ability to write some details.When I'am bathing,I find another way to improve my English.I will take notes here,which includes some important phrases and words I don't know.     That's all for diary.  10/28
