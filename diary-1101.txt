Today ,we have a test in which we have to run 1000 meters. We have already been trained for many times. But when we run, it's still difficult for us to finish with an A. I used to ride bike to school,and by this means, I  had a more healthy living style at that time. This good habit became to fade soon after I broke arm when riding a bicycle. I have an obvious feelings that I am very tired after the test.Not only should I pay attention to my study,but also my health conditions.
