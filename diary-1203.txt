Now that I have time to write about my diary.I am very busy and tired this days.We have a lot of homework to do every day.I knew that the final examination is coming,I have to make full use of my time.Now,I have an idea.I decide to write the comtext again.First,I should have rest.I always go to bed before half past eleven even if I don't finish my homework.I can always find some classmates sleeping in class,and they often spend more time on what he should have known.I always give priority to rest.I also exercise on weekends.I go cycling every Sunday,it can refresh my brain.
